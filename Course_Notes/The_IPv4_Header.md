# 10. THE IPv4 HEADER

INTERNET PROTOCOL version 4 HEADER or IPv4 HEADER

HEADER is used at LAYER 3 to help send data between devices on separate networks, even on other sides of the world over the Internet.

This is known as ROUTING.

THE IPv4 HEADER is used to ENCAPSULATE a TCP or UDP Segment.

#### Version:

- LENGTH is 4 bits.
- IDs version of IP used (IPv4 or IPv6)
    - IPv4 = 0100 in Binary (Decimal 4)
    - IPv6 = 0110 in Binary (Decimal 6)

---

#### Internet Header Length (IHL):

- LENGTH is 4 bits.
- The final field of the IPv4 Header (```Options```) is variable in length, so this field is necessary to indicate the total length of the header.
- IDs the length of the header in 4-BYTE INCREMENTS.
- The **MINIMUM** value is 5 (5 * 4-bytes = 20 bytes) - Empty OPTIONS Field
- The **MAXIMUM** value is 15 (15 * 4-bytes = 60 bytes)

MINIMUM IPv4 HEADER LENGTH = 20 Bytes!
MAXIMUM IPv4 HEADER LENGTH = 60 Bytes!

---

#### Differentiated Services Code Point (DSCP):

- LENGTH is 6 bits.
- Used for QoS (Quality of Service)
- Used to prioritize delay-sensitive data (streaming voice, video, etc.)

---

#### Explicit Congestion Notification (ECN):

- LENGTH is 2 bits.
- Provides end-to-end (between two endpoints) notification of network congestion WITHOUT dropping packets.
- Optional feature that requires both endpoints, as well as the underlying network infrastructure to support it.

---

#### Total Length:

- LENGTH is 16 bits.
- Indicates the TOTAL length of the packet (L3 Header + L4 Segment)
- Measured in bytes (not 4-byte increments like IHL)
- Minimum value of 20 bytes (IPv4 Header with NO encapsulated data)
- Maximum value of 65,535 bytes (MAXIMUM 16-bit value) = 2^16

---

#### Identification:

- LENGTH is 16 bits.
- If a packet is fragmented due to being too large, this field is used to identify which packet the fragment belongs to.
- All fragments of the same packet will have their own IPv4 header with the same value in this field.
- Packets are fragmented, if larger than the MTU (Maximum Transmission Unit)
- The MTU is usually 1500 bytes (Max size of an Ethernet frame)
- Fragments are reassembled by the receiving host.

---

#### Flags:

- LENGTH is 3 bits
- Used to control/identify fragments.
- Bit 0: Reserved, always set to 0.
- Bit 1: **Don't Fragment** (**DF bit**), used to indicate a packet that should not be fragmented.
- Bit 2: **More Fragments** (**MF bit**), set to 1 if there are more fragments in the packet, set to 0 for the last fragment or NO fragments.

---

#### Fragment Offset:

- LENGTH is 13 bits
- Used to indicated the position of the fragment w/in the original, unfragmented IP Packet.
- Allows fragmented packets to be reassembled even if the fragments arrive out of order.

---

#### Time to Live (TTL):

- LENGTH is 8 bits
- A router will drop a packet with a TTL of 0
- Used to prevent infinite loops
- Originally designed to indicated a packets maximum lifetime in seconds.
- In practice, it indicates a 'hop count': each time the packet arrives at a router, the router decreases the TTL by 1.
- Recommended default TTL is 64.

---

#### Protocol:

- LENGTH is 8 bits
- Indicates the protocol of the encapsulated Layer 4 PDU
- Value of 1 : ICMP
- Value of 6 : TCP
- Value of 17 : UDP
- Value of 89 : OSPF (a dynamic-routing protocol)
- List of protocol numbers on Wikipedia : List of IP Protocol Numbers

---

#### Header Checksum:

- LENGTH is 16 bits
- A calculated checksum used to check for errors in the IPv4 header.
- When a router receives a packet, it calculates the checksum of the header and compares it to the one in this field of a header.
- If they do not match, the router drops the packet.
- Used to check for ERRORS only in the IPv4 Header.
- IP relies on the encapsulated protocol to detect errors in the encapsulated data.
- Both TCP and UDP have their own checksum fields to detect errors in the encapsulated data.

---

#### Source and Destination:

- LENGTH is 32 bits each
- SOURCE IP = IPv4 ADDRESS of the Sender of the Packet.
- DESTINATION IP = IPv4 ADDRESS of the intended Receiver of the Packet.

---

#### Options:

- LENGTH is 0-320 bits
- Optional / Rarely Used
- If the IHL field is greater than 5, it means that Options are present.
